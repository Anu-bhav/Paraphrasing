# Paraphrasing
The tool uses the Quillbot website to paraphrase a formatted text file.

The text file must contain a sentence on each line.

Then the paraphrasing tool will read line by line and it will get multiple alternatives of the original line.

Finally it will produce a word document file containing the original text followed by the alternatives.

The word document will be saved in the Drafts directory and it will have the same name of the formatted text file.

The "Drafts" directory needs to be created as a child directory.

In the File Samples folder, there are some files to refer to.
